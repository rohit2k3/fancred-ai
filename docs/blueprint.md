## Core Features:

- Wallet Connection: Connect MetaMask or Socios Wallet (Reown) for user authentication and interaction with the Chiliz Chain Testnet.
- Fan Score Engine: Calculate a Superfan Score based on wallet activity such as number of NFTs held and transaction count, fetched from Chiliz testnet explorer API (mocked initially).

- Revenue Model: Implement a minting fee (e.g., 1 CHZ) for the NFT badge as a revenue model. Offer optional fan staking vault with token perks (bonus).
